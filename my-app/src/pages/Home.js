With the use of raspberry pi's, QR codes, and a large database of students, Trace will be able to alert staff, and parents of what time their student/s got to school, what time they checked into class, and what time they left. Trace is a great tool for schools, especially with the rising concern of lockdowns, staff will be able to track students and what time they left the classroom, and where they were going. It will also alert staff if their student checked into another classroom during either a lockdown, tornado drill, or any other occurrence that might mix the student with the wrong class.</h4></>
